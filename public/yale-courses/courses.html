A student must be sponsored by a faculty member who sets requirements and meets weekly with the student. One or more written examinations and/or a term paper are required. To register, the student must submit a written plan of study approved by the faculty instructor to the director of undergraduate studies. Students are encouraged to apply during the term preceding the tutorial. The proposal must be submitted by Friday, September 6, for the fall term and Tuesday, January 21, for the spring term. The final paper is due in the hands of the director of undergraduate studies by Friday, December 6,&#160;for the fall term and Friday, April 25, for the spring term. In special cases, with approval of the director of undergraduate studies, this course may be elected for more than one term, but only one term will count as an elective for the major. Normally, faculty sponsors must be members of the EEB department.    Fulfills the senior requirement for the B.A. degree if taken in the senior year.

     Individual or small-group study for qualified students who wish to investigate an area of ecology or evolutionary biology not presently covered by regular courses. A student must be sponsored by a faculty member who sets requirements and meets weekly with the student. One or more written examinations and/or a term paper are required. To register, the student must submit a written plan of study approved by the faculty instructor to the director of undergraduate studies. Students are encouraged to apply during the term preceding the tutorial. The proposal must be submitted by Friday, September 6, for the fall term and Tuesday, January 21, for the spring term. The final paper is due in the hands of the director of undergraduate studies by Friday, December 6,&#160;for the fall term and Friday, April 25, for the spring term. In special cases, with approval of the director of undergraduate studies, this course may be elected for more than one term, but only one term will count as an elective for the major. Normally, faculty sponsors must be members of the EEB department.    Fulfills the senior requirement for the B.A. degree if taken in the senior year.

     One term of original research in an area relevant to ecology or evolutionary biology. This may involve, for example, laboratory work, fieldwork, or mathematical or computer modeling. Students may also work in areas related to environmental biology such as policy, economics, or ethics. The research project may not be a review of relevant literature but must be original. In all cases students must have a faculty sponsor who oversees the research and is responsible for the rigor of the project. Students are expected to spend ten hours per week on their research projects. Using the form available from the office of undergraduate studies or from the Classes server, students must submit a research proposal that has been approved by the faculty sponsor to the director of undergraduate studies, preferably during the term preceding the research. Proposals are due Friday, September 6,&#160;for the fall term and Tuesday, January 21, for the spring term.

     One term of intensive original research during the senior year under the sponsorship of a Yale faculty member. Similar to other research courses except that a more substantial portion of a student&#8217;s time and effort should be spent on the research project (a minimum average of twenty hours per week). A research proposal approved by the sponsoring faculty member must be submitted to the instructor; forms are available from the office of undergraduate studies or from the instructor. For the fall term, approval is encouraged during the the spring term of the junior year and must be done by Friday, September 6; for the spring term, submission of the research proposal is encouraged during the fall term and must be done by Tuesday, January 21. Students who wish to take both E&amp;EB 495 and 496 under the sponsorship of the same faculty member may submit a single proposal by the fall deadline; in this case, the grade assigned at the end of the spring term applies to all four credits. Students who take 495 and 496 under the sponsorship of different faculty members complete an interim oral report and submit a final paper in each term; a separate grade is assigned in each term.

     Students deciding to write one-term senior essays by enrolling in ECON 491, or two-term senior essays by enrolling in ECON 491 and 492, must choose their topics and advisers by Monday, September 30, 2013. One-term senior essays are due at the end of the last week of classes in the fall term. Two-term senior essays are due on April 4, 2014. Students writing one-term senior essays who would like to be considered for Distinction in the Major must submit three copies of their essay to the Economics department office by April 4, 2014. Advisers are chosen with the assistance of the director of undergraduate studies. The format and character of the departmental senior essay may vary to suit the interest of the student and the demands of the topic, but it is expected that the tools and concepts of economic analysis will be employed and that the essay will contain original research. Paper lengths may vary; the normal expectation is thirty pages. Students may receive up to two credits for the senior essay, though it counts as only one departmental seminar whether one or two terms are taken. Meetings for seniors to discuss the senior essay will be held on  Wednesday, August 28, at 4:30 p.m. and Thursday, August 29, at 1:30 p.m.  in Room 106, 28 Hillhouse Avenue. Seniors planning to write either a one-term or a two-term senior essay should attend one of these meetings. Details regarding calculation of Distinction will be discussed and senior essay guidelines will be distributed.

  <h3>
   Departmental Seminars
  </h3>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   Juniors majoring in History must take at least two departmental seminars from two different geographical areas. Seminars on the history of the United States or Canada are numbered 100J to 199J; seminars on Britain and Europe are 200J to 299J; and seminars on Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East are 300J to 399J. Seminars numbered in the 400s address global topics; students must apply to the director of undergraduate studies in History to count a 400-level seminar toward a particular geographical distribution category.&#160;Each departmental seminar aims to acquaint students in a substantial and professional way with the literature of a period in history; to train them as far as possible in the use of primary source materials; to introduce them to problems of bibliography, historiography, and historical method; and to give them training in the writing of history. The relative importance of these objectives in any particular seminar depends on its subject matter, the previous preparation of its students, and the availability of materials.
  </p>
  <p>
   <span>
    Each term prospective junior History majors should apply for
   </span>
   departmental
   <span>
    seminars for the following term using the online
   </span>
   <span>
    seminar preregistration site. Preregistration begins after midterm in the fall for seminars offered in the spring term, and after spring recess for seminars offered in the subsequent fall term. Accelerated students holding junior status must notify the undergraduate History administrator in 237 HGS, 432-1359, by October 11 in the fall and by March 21 in the spring in order to be eligible to preregister for the following term's seminars. All students who wish to preregister must declare their major beforehand.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p>
   <span>
    In September and in January, application for admission should be made directly to the instructors of the seminars, who will admit students to remaining vacancies in their seminars. Priority is given to applications from juniors, then seniors, majoring in History, but applications are also accepted from qualified sophomores and from students majoring in other disciplines or programs. The department seeks wherever possible to accommodate students' preferences; for their part, students should recognize that limitations imposed by the size of seminars (normally fifteen students) make accommodation impossible in some instances. HIST 494 and residential college seminars that count toward the History major do not fulfill the
   </span>
   departmental
   <span>
    seminar requirement.

     For students who wish, under the supervision of a member of the faculty, to investigate an area of history not covered by regular departmental offerings. The course may be used for research or for directed reading. It is normally taken only once. The emphasis of the tutorial is on writing a long essay or several short ones. To apply for admission, a student should present the following materials to the director of undergraduate studies on the Friday before schedules are due: a prospectus of the work proposed, a bibliography, and a letter of support from a member of the History department faculty who will direct the tutorial. A form to simplify this process is available from the office of the director of undergraduate studies.

     There will be a mandatory senior essay meeting on Monday, September 9, 2013, in 114 SSS at 4 p.m.  Preparation of the required senior departmental essay under the supervision of a member of the faculty. Students expecting to graduate in May enroll in HIST 495a during the fall term and complete their essays in HIST 496b in the spring term. December graduates enroll in HIST 495b in the spring term and complete their essays in HIST 496a during the following fall term; students planning to begin their essay in the spring term should notify the senior essay director by December 2, 2013. Each student majoring in History must present a completed Statement of Intention, signed by a department member who has agreed to serve as adviser, to the undergraduate History administrator in 237 HGS no later than September 16, 2013 (for HIST 495a), or January 17, 2014 (for 495b). Blank statement forms are available in 237 HGS before the end of a student's junior year, and thereafter in the Senior Essay handbook. Students writing a senior essay must attend a
     <a href="http://www.library.yale.edu/instruction/hist" target="_blank">
      library workshop for historians
     </a>
     . Students enrolled in HIST 495 submit to their advisers a prospectus of the essay and an annotated bibliography during the course of the term, and at least ten pages of the essay or a detailed outline of the entire project by December 2, 2013 (495a), or May 5, 2014 (495b). Those who meet these requirements receive a temporary grade of SAT, which will be changed to the grade received by the essay upon its completion. Failure to meet any requirement may result in the student's being asked to withdraw from HIST 495.  Students enrolled in HIST 496 must submit a completed essay to 211 HGS no later than 5 p.m. on April 7, 2014, in the spring term, or no later than 5 p.m. on December 2, 2013, in the fall term. Essays submitted after 5 p.m. will be considered as having been turned in on the following day. If the essay is submitted late without an excuse from the student's residential college dean, the penalty is one letter grade for the first day and one-half letter grade for each of the next two days past the deadline. No essay that would otherwise pass will be failed because it is late, but late essays will not be considered for departmental or Yale College prizes. All senior departmental essays will be judged by members of the faculty other than the adviser. In order to graduate from Yale College, a student majoring in History must achieve a passing grade on the departmental essay.  The essays should take the form of substantial articles, not longer than 12,500 words (approximately forty double-spaced typewritten pages), with the total word count given at the end of the essay. This is a maximum limit; there is no minimum requirement. Length will vary according to the topic and the historical techniques employed. Essays generally run between 10,000 and 12,500 words. The limitation on length is regarded as important because precision, clarity, and conciseness are essential to good historical writing. A brief evaluation of major sources is required. Consult the director of the senior essay course for details.

     Preparation of a research paper about thirty pages long under the direction of a qualified instructor. The essay is written in either the fall or the spring term of the senior year, though preferably in the fall term. Students write on subjects of their own choice. During the term before the essay is written, students plan the project in consultation with a qualified instructor or with the director of undergraduate studies.&#160;No student is permitted to enroll in HSAR 499 without submitting a project statement, with the formal title of the essay and a brief description of&#160;the subject to be treated. The statement must be signed by the student's adviser and presented to the director of undergraduate studies before the student's schedule can be approved.  The student must submit a suitable project outline and bibliography to the adviser and the director of undergraduate studies early in the term. The outline should indicate the focus and scope of the essay topic, as well as the proposed research methodology; the bibliography should be annotated. Students must also complete a library research colloquium for the senior essay. For essays submitted in the fall term, the deadline for the outline is September 13; for those in the spring term, January 24. Senior essays written in the fall term are due on December 6; those in the spring term on April 25. Two copies must be submitted to the director of undergraduate studies. Failure to comply with any deadline will be penalized by a lower final grade. No late essay will be considered for a prize in the department.  Permission may be given to write a two-term essay after consultation with an adviser and the director of undergraduate studies. Only those who have begun to do advanced work in a given area and whose project is considered to be of exceptional promise are eligible. The requirements for the one-term senior essay apply to the two-term essay, except that the essay should be from fifty to sixty pages in length.

   STAT 101&#150;106, Introduction to Statistics
  </h3>
  <p>
   A basic introduction to statistics, including numerical and graphical summaries of data, probability, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression. Each course in this group focuses on applications to a particular field of study and is taught jointly by two instructors, one specializing in statistics and the other in the relevant area of application. The first seven weeks of classes are attended by all students in STAT 101&#150;106 together, as general concepts and methods of statistics are developed. The remaining weeks are divided into field-specific sections that develop the concepts with examples and applications. Computers are used for data analysis. These courses are alternatives; they do not form a sequence and only one may be taken for credit. No prerequisites beyond high school algebra. May not be taken after STAT 100 or 109.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Students enrolled in STAT 101&#150;106 who wish to change to STAT 109, or those enrolled in STAT 109 who wish to change to STAT 101&#150;106, must submit a course change notice, signed by the instructor, to their residential college dean by Friday, September 27. The approval of the Committee on Honors and Academic Standing is not required.

      THST&#160;491
     </a>
     , even when not undertaken by a senior. If the independent study is a performance or directing project, the adviser visits rehearsals and performances at the mutual convenience of adviser and student. The project must be accompanied by an essay of about fifteen pages, worth about half the final grade. Although the paper's requirements vary with the project and its adviser, it must be more than a rehearsal log. The paper typically engages interpretative and performance issues as revealed in other productions of the work (if they exist). The writing should be concomitant with rehearsal, to enable each to inform the other, and a draft must be presented to, and commented on by, the adviser at least a week before&#8212;not after&#8212;the final performance. The final version of the paper, incorporating adjustments and reflections, should be turned in to the adviser no later than ten days after the performance closes, and no later than the first day of the final examination period.  An essay project entails substantial reading, at least four meetings with the adviser, and a paper or papers totaling at least twenty pages. A playwriting project normally requires twenty new script pages every two weeks of the term and regular meetings with the adviser. A final draft of the entire script is the culmination of the term's work.  Application forms are available from the director of undergraduate studies. Juniors may use one term of these courses to prepare for their senior projects.    Open to juniors and seniors. Prerequisites:
